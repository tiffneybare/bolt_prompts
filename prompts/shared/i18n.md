# 🌐 Internationalization (i18n) & Localization Strategy

Enable seamless support for multiple languages and regions by implementing a robust i18n system that scales with your product.

---

## 🧩 Core Setup

- **Framework:** Use `react-i18next` or similar based on the frontend stack
- **Translation Files:** Store strings in JSON/YAML grouped by feature (e.g., `auth.json`, `dashboard.json`)
- **Language Detection:** Auto-detect from browser settings with manual override option
- **Fallback Locale:** Default to `en-US` if preferred language is unavailable

---

## 🧪 Implementation Prompts

**UI Elements:**
- Replace all static strings with translation keys
- Ensure plurals and variables are handled correctly
- Add support for right-to-left (RTL) text if needed

**Backend/API:**
- Include `Accept-Language` headers for all requests
- Return translated content or localized error messages

**Marketing Pages:**
- Include SEO meta tags (`<html lang="">`, `hreflang`, etc.)
- Generate static site versions for each language

## 🛠️ Developer Considerations

- Use `i18n.t('key')` with context-aware keys
- Enable live-reloading of language files in dev mode
- Write tests to ensure all keys are covered and no untranslated strings appear in prod
