# ðŸ§  Global Design Instructions

All pages and components should be beautiful, production-worthy, and visually modern â€” not generic or cookie cutter. Prioritize:

- Clean, responsive layouts that adapt across devices
- Modern design patterns (grid systems, cards, modals, etc.)
- Great UX with clear hierarchy and strong call-to-actions
- Accessible colors, semantic HTML, and keyboard nav support
- Use TailwindCSS (or project-defined framework) effectively
- Add subtle motion and polish (e.g., hover states, transitions)
- Think like a product designer â€” not just a coder
- Donâ€™t build wireframes â€” build the final product
