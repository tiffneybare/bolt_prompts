# üõ†Ô∏è Admin Panel

Create a fully functional admin panel that allows system administrators to manage key aspects of the platform.

---

## Features

- View and manage all users (search, filter, pagination)
- Modify user roles and permissions
- Suspend or deactivate user accounts
- View app-wide metrics and logs
- Manage system-wide settings and feature flags
- Export data for reporting purposes

---

## Pages

- `/admin`: Admin dashboard home
- `/admin/users`: User management
- `/admin/settings`: System settings
- `/admin/flags`: Feature flags
- `/admin/logs`: System logs and error reports

---

## Technical Considerations

- Role-based access control (RBAC) must restrict access to authorized admins only
- Prefer server-side pagination for scalability
- Include an audit log table that records admin actions
- Built using a modular architecture to allow for easy extension

---

## UI

Use a consistent layout with a collapsible sidebar and breadcrumbs. Design should be minimalist and highly readable. Ensure accessibility and responsiveness across screen sizes.

---

## Notes

- Stub out any backend integration with mock data
- Use placeholder toggles for feature flags
- Use table and modal components from the shared component librarys
