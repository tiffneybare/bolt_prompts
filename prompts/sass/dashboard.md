# ðŸ“Š Analytics Dashboard

Create a flexible, component-driven dashboard for authenticated users with widget support and real-time metrics.

---

## Dashboard Goals

- Show key metrics relevant to the userâ€™s plan (e.g., usage, contacts, revenue)
- Provide access to recent activity or insights
- Display notifications or alerts when needed
- Include custom widgets per feature module

---

## Widgets

| Widget Name       | Purpose                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Usage Meter       | Track current usage against limits     |
| Activity Feed     | Show recent logins or changes          |
| Billing Snapshot  | Current plan, next billing date        |
| Conversion Funnel | Optional for sales-oriented apps       |
| Notifications     | System messages, billing warnings      |

## Implementation Notes

- Modular widget system with configurable layout
- Widgets are loaded lazily and asynchronously
- Dashboard layout persists between sessions
- Users can toggle visibility of optional widgets

---

## Tech Stack Suggestions

- Chart.js or Recharts for graphs
- Zustand or Redux for widget state
- API layer caches recent data for fast load

---

## Optional Additions

- Add team performance summaries (if teams exist)
- Allow drag-and-drop reordering of widgets
- Provide export/print/share dashboard actions (stubbed)

---

## Dev Stub Guidelines

- Include mocked widget data for all chart elements
- Show empty states for dashboards with no data
- Include a dashboard layout grid in `components/layout/`
