### 🧱 Modular Architecture for SaaS Applications

This SaaS application follows a scalable modular architecture with strict separation of concerns and performance-first principles.

## 🧩 Code Splitting Strategy

- **Route-based Splitting** using `React.lazy()` + `Suspense`
- **Feature Isolation**: Only load what's needed per page
- **Chunk Optimization**:
  - Vendor chunk for third-party deps
  - Shared components split into common bundles

---

## Performance Targets

- Each route should stay under 100KB (gzipped)
- First Contentful Paint (FCP): under 1.5 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): under 2.5 seconds

---

## Notes

This architecture should be applied from the initial project bootstrapping phase and enforced consistently across all modules.
