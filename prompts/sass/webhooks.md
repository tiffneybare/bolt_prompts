# 🔗 Webhook Support

Add flexible webhook support so users (or internal systems) can receive real-time data from important app events like new signups, billing events, or custom triggers.

---

## ✅ Goals

- Allow users to register external webhook URLs
- Trigger outbound POSTs on specific events
- Add signing secret for security
- Show delivery logs & retry failed attempts

---

## 🚀 Example Webhook Events

- `user.created`
- `billing.subscription.updated`
- `email.campaign.clicked`
- `feedback.submitted`
- (Any custom app events you define)

---

## 🔧 Features to Generate

- `/api/webhooks/register` – register/update a webhook
- `/api/webhooks/test` – send sample payload
- Webhook database table:
  - `userId`, `url`, `events[]`, `secret`, `lastTriggered`, `status`
- Admin dashboard to view user webhooks & delivery logs

---

## 🔐 Security

- Add HMAC SHA256 signature header using stored secret
- Include `timestamp` and `event` in payload
- Log all payloads and response codes

---

## 💥 Retry Logic

- Retry 3x with backoff for 5xx responses
- Mark permanently failed if all retries fail
- Allow manual re-send from admin panel

---

## ✨ Bonus Features

- Webhook monitor with delivery stats
- Slack or email alert for persistent failures
- Support per-event secrets or grouped by category

---

## 🧩 Sample Payload

```json
{
  "event": "user.created",
  "timestamp": 1721234567890,
  "data": {
    "id": "user_abc123",
    "email": "newuser@example.com"
  }
}
