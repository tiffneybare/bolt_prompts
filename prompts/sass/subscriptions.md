# 💳 Subscription Management

Build a complete subscription system for the SaaS app. Support free trials, plan upgrades/downgrades, usage-based billing, and invoice history.

## 📦 What to Generate

- `Plan` and `Subscription` models
- Billing portal integration (Stripe or other)
- Webhooks for subscription events (create, cancel, fail, etc.)
- Plan enforcement middleware
- Admin override tools for free credits or plan switching

---
