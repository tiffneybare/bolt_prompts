SEO Considerations
Meta tags per page

JSON-LD schema per page type:

WebSite for homepage

Product for pricing

Organization for about

Friendly and shareable OG tags

Sitemap and robots.txt stubbed

Dev Notes
All public routes live under src/marketing

Each page should include its own <SEO /> component

Use markdown for content blocks when possible
