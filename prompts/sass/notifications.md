# üîî Notification System Setup

This prompt handles the generation of a modular notification system for sending emails, in-app messages, and optionally push or SMS.

---

## ‚úÖ Goals

- Set up a notification service with plug-and-play channels (email, in-app, push, SMS).
- Ensure notifications are templated and reusable.
- Integrate with real-time systems for delivery where applicable.
- Provide user-level preferences and opt-in controls.

---

## üì¶ What to Generate

- `notificationService.js` to handle dispatching across channels.
- Templates directory (e.g., `/notifications/templates/`).
- Default templates: Welcome, Password Reset, Billing Reminder, New Feature Alert.
- A `NotificationPreferences` model tied to users.
- Basic UI for toggling notification preferences.
