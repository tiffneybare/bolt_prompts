# 👩‍💼 Admin Role Setup

Define the initial admin role, permissions, and associated capabilities. This should establish the core user who can oversee and manage the application.

---

## Purpose

Create a default "Admin" role that has full access to system functionality upon initial project setup.

---

## Capabilities

- Access to `/admin` routes
- Can view and manage all users
- Can change billing/subscription status of users
- Can enable/disable feature flags
- Can modify global settings
- Can assign and revoke roles to/from users

---

## Implementation

- Seed an initial admin user during setup
- Use role-based access control (RBAC)
- Allow elevating other users to admin (with confirmation prompt)
- Log admin privilege changes in the audit log

---

## Edge Cases

- Admin should not be able to delete themselves
- Admins should receive elevated security requirements (2FA, alerts on suspicious activity)

---

## UI Notes

- Admin badge in user tables
- Elevated privilege confirmation modals when assigning admin roles
- Admin-only views clearly marked in the UI
