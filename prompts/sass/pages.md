## üß∞ Page Structure

Each page should live in its folder:
src/
marketing/
home/
page.tsx
components/
app/
dashboard/
page.tsx
components/


Each `page.tsx` should:

- Include SEO metadata via `<SEO />` component
- Import tracking helpers for GA/GTM
- Be wrapped in layout if needed

---

## Dev Notes

- Use route groups for `/app/` vs public
- Each auth page uses a shared `AuthLayout`
- Contact form should POST to API route or webhook
