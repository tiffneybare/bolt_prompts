### ‚ùì Pre-Generation Clarification Questions

Before generating the full app, ask the following:

1. What is the name and purpose of this SaaS product?
2. Which core pages should be included (e.g. pricing, signup, dashboard)?
3. Will users manage subscriptions within the app?
4. Do you want login via email only or also social logins?
5. Should there be an analytics dashboard or admin panel?
6. Will this include marketing pages or just the app shell?

Only proceed once key answers are provided or stub placeholder logic is acceptable.
