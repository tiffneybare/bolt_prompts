## ⚙️ Usage

1. **Clone this repo into your workspace:**

git clone https://github.com/your-username/bolt_prompts.git
cd bolt_prompts

Generate a prompt for a SaaS app or website:

This will output a clean, formatted prompt.md with modular logic.

🛠 Optional: Use scaffold.sh in Your Bolt Project
To pull in the latest prompts and auto-generate prompt.md from this repo:

This script:

Clones/updates this repo if needed

Runs build.js

Copies prompt.md into the active project

Sets up .bolt/on-generate.md if defined

🧩 Prompt Philosophy
Each .md file:

Contains a specific domain of concern (auth, SEO, pricing, etc.)

Can be reused across multiple project types

Is designed to evolve over time—update any piece without breaking the whole

🔧 Maintenance
Add new prompt sections to shared/, saas/, or website/ as needed

Rerun build.js anytime prompts change

Always keep prompt.md under version control in your actual Bolt project

✅ Best Practices
Keep your prompts descriptive but flexible

Use comments in markdown to guide AI interpretation

Add auto-tracking logic (for analytics) and SEO blocks early
